# LoxChat

LoxChat is a basic Instant Message Application that allows people to connect from all over the world.

The application supports:

- Sending and receiving text messages in real-time;
- Persistent messages storage;
- Retrieval of past received messages when the user was offline;
- Basic analysis on to whom a given person talks to the most (based on the number of messages);
- OAuth 2.0 Authentication.

For this challenge, we expect you to:

- Fork or clone the repository of this challenge to your GitHub (or equivalent) profile;
- Design and implement a system that meets the requirements listed above using microservices; 
- Implement, at least, the analysis system using the Kafka Message queue;
- Create a final docker-compose file with the whole architecture of the application.

Notes:

- The application can be a simple CLI or HTML application; UI/UX Design is not important for this challenge;
- We provide you a docker-compose.yml file for you to get started. Feel free to change it according to your needs;
- We do not expect you to use any specific technology; pick one youâ€™re familiar with the most and try not to spend a lot of time solving this challenge;
- You may keep your code private and send us the end result e-mail to david.silva@satcom-int.com;
- Feel free to send any doubts you have about this challenge to that same e-mail address.
